# prosody_manipulator
This is a really simple program that can be used to manipulate the duration 
and prosodic contour of a word or utterance. 

To use it, you must first have a sound selected (highlighted) in Praat's Objects window. Then run the script. 
You'll have to provide the final duration you'd like your sound to have, and 
the pitch values for each of the ten equally-spaced intervals of the contour. 
Then, click on Ok (or Apply). The program will create a few new objects. The final sound 
("Sound fromManipulationEditor") will be the manipulated object.
